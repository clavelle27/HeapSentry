clothstore sells different clothes of different prices. The goal of this attack is to overwrite the price of a product with a lower price so that we can purchase costly products for lesser price. As we are not hijacking the control flow, this is a Non_Control Attack. We are modifying a non-control variable for our gains.

In order to launch an attack, just get the malloced location of the product user wants t buy and the malloced location of the existing products in the store. Just enter as many As as the difference between these two locations plus 1. For example if prod is on heap at 0x1000 and prod_list is at 0x120, write 33 A's as the product you want to purchase. This will cut the cost of the first product from $500 to $256. Note that since we are entering all As that doesnt match with any product in the store, you will not able to purchase anything in the first attempt. But on a second attempt, you will be able to purchase the first product for the rigged price.
